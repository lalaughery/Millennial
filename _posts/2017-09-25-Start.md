Hi there! I'm Lucas. I'm a Post-Doctoral Researcher in structural engineering with interests in reinforced concrete, earthquake engineering, and the response of structures to extreme events. I also dabble in data, do a bit of photography, and home brew. This is a place for me to share my experience.
